# HangMan

Hangman game which i'm sure you all know about.

I've added random words from a website and generated a random word everytime you play.

although I did not put that much time in the interface itself, I encourage you to do it if you know Python :)

also... alsooo; There is AN ERROR here in this file. 

for some reason the letter the user inputs gets printed in the next line of the input line. I know why, but I dont know how to fix it. so TRY to do it.
